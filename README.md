Laby video game

The idea is to recreat a labyrinth game in Pygame with Python3.5
Controls are keyboard arrows
All the needs for further developpement are listed in TODO_laby_dev.txt

Thanks for any help


The laby_main_updgradeV1.py is the main script, all the classes and constantes are described in laby_classes.py  and laby_constantes.py


Thoses scripts are in python 3.5 using the suitable version of pygame, its was developp on a windows 7 environmment.

To control the game with the mousse, use the script  Laby_main_sourie.py

##Â Start

```
$ python start.py
